Known Issues:

- Enabling Data Collect from core Application running in sh clustering causes error while applying sh bundle:

Currently when enabling Data collect from the core application when running in sh clustering mode will cause trouble while applying new sh bundle, with error from deployer
like:

xx-xx-xxxx xx:xx:xx.xxx -0700 WARN  AppsDeployHandler - Error while deploying apps to first member: ConfDeploymentException: Error while updating app=nmon on
target=https://xx.xx.xx.xx:8089: Non-200/201 status_code=500; {"messages":[{"type":"ERROR","text":"\n In handler 'localapps': Error installing application: 
Failed to copy /opt/splunk/var/run/splunk/bundle_tmp/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/nmon to /opt/splunk/etc/apps/nmon: No such file or directory"}]}

Or a "file text busy error"

This is currently under Analysis, it is recommended as far know to deactivate collecting data from head search nodes running in sh cluster mode.
Thought, an alternative can be to install a Universal Forwarder on search heads and deploy the TA-nmon.
