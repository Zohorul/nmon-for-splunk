**NMON is short for Nigel's Performance Monitor, it is available on AIX Systems, Solaris (with Sarmon), and Linux Systems.**

* nmon for Linux is open source under GPL: http://nmon.sourceforge.net

* nmon for AIX is not open source but is integrated into topas command from:

   * AIX 5.3 TL09
   * AIX 6.1 TL02

See: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/WikiPtype/nmon

* nmon for Solaris (formerly sarmon) is open source and available for Solaris 10/11: http://www.geckotechnology.com/sarmon

This is a great "all in one" Performance Monitor tool that provides a very large amount of system performance information, and it can be used in different scenarios.

The first way to use NMON is running the "nmon" command in terminal, which opens a Real time monitoring terminal interface, giving you access to many system metrics within a single screen:

nmon is also very often used as a Capacity Planning and Performance tool by running the nmon process in a csv generating mode all along it's run time, for later cold Analyse.

Analysing NMON csv data is not easy because it has a very specific format Splunk cannot directly manage. (one big problem stands in the event time stamp identification which is very uncommon and defined by a non time stamp pattern)

This is why I decided to develop this App, based on my own professional experience in Unix systems Capacity Planning, to provide to anyone interested a powerful too to Analyse NMON data with an Enterprise Class Application.

************
How it works
************

**In a few words, here is how the App works:**

* The Nmon core application contains all the views, data models, configurations and related objects
* The TA-nmon which is the technical addon for the Nmon Performance application contains binaries and scripts to manage the nmon data
* The TA-nmon once installed starts immediately to collect and transforms nmon performance and configuration data
* The default configuration indexes data into the "nmon" index (by default)

Splunk Data structure
*********************

---------
nmon_data
---------

Performance metrics data ordered by the key "type" which corresponds to the nmon section metric item (CPU_ALL, LPARâ€¦)::

   index=nmon sourcetype=nmon_data

Eventtype:::

   eventtype=nmon:performance

-----------
nmon_config
-----------

Configuration data extracted by nmon2csv converters, corresponds to AAA and BBB* sections of nmon raw data::

   index=nmon sourcetype=nmon_config

Eventtype:::

   eventtype=nmon:config

------------
nmon_collect
------------

Output of the nmon_helper.sh script which is responsible for nmon instances launches::

   index=nmon sourcetype=nmon_collect

Eventtype:::

   eventtype=nmon:collect

---------------
nmon_processing
---------------

Output of nmon2csv Python and Perl converters (conversion of nmon raw data into csv data)::

   index=nmon sourcetype=nmon_processing

Eventtype:::

   eventtype=nmon:collect

----------
nmon_clean
----------

Output of the nmon_cleaner.sh script (interface to nmon_helper.py | nmon_helper.pl) which is responsible for nmon raw data file cleaning::

   index=nmon sourcetype=nmon_clean

Eventtype:::

   eventtype=nmon:clean


******************
Available packages
******************

**There are different packages:**

* The ***Nmon core*** Application: this is the whole package you download in Splunk App (directory called "nmon")
* The **PA-nmon_light** addon, available in the Git repository https://github.com/guilhemmarchand/PA-nmon_light (tgz archive), this package is expected to be deployed in indexers
* The **TA-nmon** addon, available in Splunk base https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3248 and https://github.com/guilhemmarchand/TA-nmon (tgz archive), can be deployed to any AIX / Linux / Solaris Full or Universal forwarder instance, master node of a cluster, deployment server, standalone instances, clustered indexers...
