NMON is short for Nigel's Performance Monitor and is available on AIX, Solaris (With Sarmon), Linux and ARM Systems.

NMON Splunk App has been designed to massively collect, convert, index and analyse NMON Metrics Data, providing an Enterprise class Application. 

Data collect can be done on standalone installation, distributed Clusters and Forwarders which makes the App fully compatible with Splunk architecture. 

Splunk for NMON does global Analysis per Host, Analysis per type of metric (CPU usage, Memory, I/O...), Predictive and Comparison Analysis for both AIX, Solaris and Linux OS.

Specific IBM Power Systems metrics such as Micro-Partitions and Pools CPU utilization are supported and exploited in provided interfaces.

Feedback and rating the App will be greatly appreciated.
