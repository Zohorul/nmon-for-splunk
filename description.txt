NMON is short for Nigel's Performance Monitor and is available on AIX, Solaris (With Sarmon), Linux and ARM Systems.

This great System Performance tool associated with Splunk power provides an Enterprise class Application to automatically collact and/or exploit NMON data ouf of the box.

NMON Splunk App is designed to massively collect, convert, index and analyse NMON Metrics Data.

Data collect can be done on standalone or indexers, and also with Splunk forwarders which makes the App fully compatible with Splunk distributed architecture. 

Splunk for NMON does global Analysis per Host, Analysis per type of metric (CPU usage, Memory, I/O...), Predictive and Comparison Analysis for both AIX, Solaris and Linux OS.

Specific IBM Power Systems metrics such as Micro-Partitions and Pools CPU utilization are supported and exploited in provided interfaces.

Feedback, comments and rating the App will be greatly appreciated.
